# Security-Tools

## Function Introduction
These are some security tools implemented with Python code. Currently, they support website scanning, DDoS, and more. You can use the code in the "Scan" section to scan IP addresses and ports, and the code in the "Attack" section for security simulations. Many features are still under development, but I will keep updating them to make them more practical and user-friendly. Suggestions for improvement are welcome, and I will address them promptly.

## A Small Suggestion
I recommend using a Linux system for operation, as many of the functionalities of Scapy can only run on Linux. Before running some Python programs, you will also need to install some third-party Python libraries, such as Scapy, pexpect, and itertools.
